# CDAC-Microcontroller-Interfacing-Assignments
Module-1 (ECP)

This repository contains assignments from the Microcontroller and Interfacing module completed during my CDAC course. The assignments focus on programming STM32 microcontrollers, covering topics such as peripheral interfacing, real-time control, and embedded systems development. Each project demonstrates practical applications and essential programming skills in the STM32 environment.
